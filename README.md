# Homework-1

This is my Homework 1 for CSE 477, Web Application development. In this assignment, I had to create a personal website with a Home, Projects and Piano pages.

Home: Picture of me, short description and bio, and a fun fact.

Projects: Display my projects in this screen, each with an image and a description, along with a link to go to each project page.

Piano: The piano page was for my first project. It is a fully functional Javascript piano that has a secret message.

Each page of the Homework must also have a header, navigation bar, main content section, and a footer.

The navigation bar must have links/buttons to all the other pages along with a link to my Resume and my LinkedIn page.

The website must be mobile-user friendly, with the grids, images and texts changing dynamically with the screen size.
